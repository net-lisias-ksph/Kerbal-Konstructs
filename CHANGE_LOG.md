* 2016-0513: 0.9.6.8_EX (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1.2

	+ If you don't like experimental features or risk of bugs, then don't update.
	+ Added Master Export function to Developer Mode. Use this to do a batch export of ALL instances to KerbalKonstructs/ExportedInstances/Master.
	+ This function doesn't care if an instance is a CustomInstance or not.
	+ The organisation is much tidier in the Master folder than when using the other export functions.
	+ Added a GroupCenter and RefCenter property to instances. If you don't want to wait for Kerbin-Side to update with these, please use the Master Export function and they'll be included in the exported cfgs.

	+ Custom bases now log launches and you can see the log in the Base Manager. Please note that the KSC does not keep this log since everyone thinks Gene should do it and he's busy with things like managing contracts... erm, controlling missions. No I don't get it either.

* 2016-0330: 0.9.5.3 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ This is a test version. If you don't want to test the latest version, then don't update.
	+ This version is compiled against the pre-release version 1.1 of KSP with a few minor code changes for compatibility with API updates. That means there has been no major overhaul of the GUI and other planned improvements that utilise the Unity update.
	+ It does not require module manager anymore. The collider "fix" is applied automatically to all static objects. All static object colliders are set concave and preliminary testing shows that Unity does still support them.
	+ It does seem to work just fine in x64, based on preliminary testing.
