# Kerbal Konstructs :: Change Log

* 2016-0401: 0.9.5.6 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ Fixed a bug in the GUI code for the Inflight Base Boss causing it to appear blank.
	+ Inflight Base Boss a little more informative when stuff can and can't be done with it.
* 2016-0331: 0.9.5.5 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ Fixed a bug where the recovery button wouldn't work when at or near a base.
* 2016-0331: 0.9.5.4 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ Fixed bug in recovery, where KSC wasn't getting cleaned up and funds was continuously increased.
	+ Cleaned up example core static cfgs so that duplication errors aren't logged incorrectly when Round Range is being spawned on game start.
* 2016-0330: 0.9.5.3 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.1
	+ This is a test version. If you don't want to test the latest version, then don't update.
	+ This version is compiled against the pre-release version 1.1 of KSP with a few minor code changes for compatibility with API updates. That means there has been no major overhaul of the GUI and other planned improvements that utilise the Unity update.
	+ It does not require module manager anymore. The collider "fix" is applied automatically to all static objects. All static object colliders are set concave and preliminary testing shows that Unity does still support them.
	+ It does seem to work just fine in x64, based on preliminary testing.
* 2016-0222: 0.9.5.2 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.0.5
	+ Non-critical update.
	+ Updated MM config to support all statics, regardless of author.
	+ Updated/validated version file.
* 2016-0218: 0.9.5.1 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.0.5
	+ This is the interim version that includes the fix for collider issues in KSP 1.0.5.
	+ Credit to Thomas P. and Joshwoo69 for the work on this.
	+ Also included the MM cfg necessary for the fix to be applied by any statics made by me.
	+ Also included the latest version of Module Manager.
* 2016-0218: 0.9.5.0 (AlphaAsh) for KSP 1.0.4
	+ No changelog provided
